Good Afternoon to all.Today I came before you to share some points about my favourite sport cricket.Cricket is an international game.It is being liked my many countries.My favourite cricketer is Rohit Sharma.There are many cricketers, who came from poor background.They proved their game with innovative skills and settled in the world of cricket.Also there are some cricketers,who are failures in their education.But they are ruling the cricket and teached many tricks to upcoming cricketers.All us of know Virat Kohli.He secured just 3 marks in English during his Intermediate.Now he is the 3rd most earning sportsmen in the world,after Messi and Ronaldo.Virat Kohli is being followed by 93.3M followers in Instagram.Let us discuss about another cricketer,M.S.Dhoni.He brought World Cup to India,only after Kapil Dev.So our country is always thankful to both of them for bringing World Cups.
